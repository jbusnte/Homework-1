        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The color orange derived its name from the fruit of the same name. 
            Before the English language adopted the word "orange," the color was often referred to as "geoluhread" in Old English, 
            which means "yellow-red. 
            Orange is considered one of the newest additions to the color spectrum in human history. Ancient civilizations didn't have a 
            specific term for the color and often used a combination of red and yellow to represent what we now know as orange."
