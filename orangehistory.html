    <p>Geoluhread is an Old English term that was used to describe the color we now refer to as orange. In Old English, "geolu" meant yellow, while "read" represented red.
         By combining these two words, geoluhread described a color that fell somewhere between yellow and red. During the Old English period, there was no distinct word for the color orange as we know it today. 
         This lack of a specific term can be attributed to the fact that orange pigments were not as readily available as red and yellow pigments. 
         The color was often referred to by using descriptions or comparisons to other colors.

    <p>It wasn't until the introduction of the fruit to Europe that the color orange gained a name of its own. Oranges were introduced to Europe through trade routes with Asia and the Middle East. 
        The fruit's vibrant, eye-catching hue caught the attention of the English-speaking world, and they started using the word "orange" to describe both the fruit and the color.

    <h2>Etimology</h2>
    <p>The word "orange" itself has an interesting etymology. It comes from the Old French term "orenge," which was derived from the Arabic word "naranj." The Arabic term originally referred to the bitter orange tree and its fruit, but it eventually became the name for the color as well. 
        This linguistic evolution reflects the influence of trade and cultural exchanges throughout history.
